#Given a collection of integers.

#Iterate through the collection one by one. 
    #- save the first value as the starting value. 
    # - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value
    #- if the saved value is greater, or it's the same
        # - move to the next value in the collection
    # - otherwise if the current value is greater
        # - reassign the saved value as the current value
# After iterating through the collection, return the saved value
