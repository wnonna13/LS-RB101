#PSEUDOCODE 

#INPUT  - integer1, integer2

#OUTPUT - addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, power

#==> Enter the first number:
#23
#==> Enter the second number:
#17
#==> 23 + 17 = 40
#==> 23 - 17 = 6
#==> 23 * 17 = 391
#==> 23 / 17 = 1
#==> 23 % 17 = 6
#==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103
