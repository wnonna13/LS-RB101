# Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.

#>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
#5
#>> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
#s
#The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.


#>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
#6
#>> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
#p
#The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

#PSEUDOCODE
#input =  integer greater than 0, s or p
#output = sum or product
