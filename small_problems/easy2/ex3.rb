#Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

# INPUT = bill amount, tip percentage
# OUPTPUT = tip amount, total bill (with bill + tip added)

# METHOD
# Ask for bill amount
    # Validate it is a number
    # Ask user if this is the correct amount
        # If yes, proceed
        # If no, go back to 1st step
# Repeat with tip percentage
# Create new saved variable = tip amount
# Create new saved variable = total after tip amount
# Calculate tip amount 
    # tip percentage * bill amount / 100
# Calculate total after tip amount
    # tip amount + bill amount 
# Create message:
    # The tip is : $tip
    # The total is : $total 
# Return message 

#What is the bill? 200
#What is the tip percentage? 15

#The tip is $30.0
#The total is $230.0
